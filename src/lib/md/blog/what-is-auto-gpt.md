You've probably heard of [OpenAI's GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) already. It's a large multimodal AI model that people are using to do all sorts of awesome things. It's currently available for [ChatGPT Plus](https://chat.openai.com/chat) users or you can get on the [waitlist for the API](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api).

Auto-GPT is autopilot for GPT-4.

## Autopilot for GPT-4

[Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT) is an open-source project built on top of GPT-4 to automate the task of automating tasks :) It's created by [Torantulino](https://github.com/Torantulino). The GitHub repo is at [Torantulino/Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT) and has been getting extremely popular in these last couple of days. Although it is mainly intended to be used with GPT-4 which isn't available to everyone yet, you can also use it with GPT-3.5 which is readily available without a waitlist.

Here is how it works:

First you create your AI and describe its role, an example would be:

- An AI designed to write high quality blog posts about design tools.

Then you enter up to 5 goals for your AI:

1. Search the web for top 5 most used design tools and understand their features.
2. Write a separate blog post about each tool and save these post to a folder.
3. Shutdown upon achieving your goal.

Then you let it run and it will try to achieve the goals you set. Keep in mind that if you are using GPT-4, things could get expensive quickly so you might want to set a budget on [OpenAI's dashboard](https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits).

## Features

Here are some of the features of Auto-GPT:

- Auto-GPT has internet access and it is able to search and gather information.
- It has short term and long term memory so that it can remember things along the way.
- It can save files to your computer and shutdown automatically when it thinks the goals you set have been achieved.
- It can even speak during the journey of achieving its goal (this part is optional and requires an [ElevenLabs](https://beta.elevenlabs.io/) account).

## Join the Experiment

Although there is a bit of a setup needed to get it running, it doesn't take much time.

To get started, you can visit the repo here: [Torantulino/Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Torantulino/Auto-GPT).

They have a Discord that you can join to talk more about it and ask questions: [Auto-GPT Discord](https://discord.gg/PQ7VX6TY4t).

The creator of the project also shares his thoughts and progress on Twitter: [Torantulino's Twitter](https://twitter.com/SigGravitas).
