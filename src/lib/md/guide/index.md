# Guide

This is a guide on how to use Stablecog. It covers everything from what each generation setting does to how to create good prompts.

It also includes information about various fine-tuned Stable Diffusion models we support such as Openjourney, Waifu Diffusion, Arcane Diffusion and original models such as Kandinsky.
