# 22h Diffusion

22h Diffusion is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model. It is created by [Predogl](https://twitter.com/Predogl) and [piEsposito](https://twitter.com/piesposi_to). According to its creators the model was trained on a large number of high quality images with simple prompts to generate beautiful images without a lot of prompt engineering.

In our tests, the model does a very good job at what it is designed for. It is a good model for generating artistic images using relatively short prompts.
