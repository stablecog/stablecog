# Openjourney

Openjourney is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model that is trained on images created with [Midjourney](https://midjourney.com). It tries to achieve the style of Midjourney images. It is created by [PromptHero](https://prompthero.com). Latest iteration of it is trained on 100K+ Midjourney v4 images.

The model does a good job of mimicking the style of Midjourney images in some cases. However, it is not very feasible to mimick the style of Midjourney images in all cases. The model does a good job at producing artistic images with relatively short prompts.
