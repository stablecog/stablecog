# Luna Diffusion

Luna Diffusion is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model that is trained on about 500 hand-picked, carefully annotated images. It is created by [@proximasan](https://twitter.com/proximasan). It's a relatively stylized model. However, it is good at wide variety of styles.

Even though it is trained on a relatively small dataset, it performs very well in producing artistic images with relatively short prompts.
