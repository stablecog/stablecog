# Redshift Diffusion

Redshift Diffusion is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on high resolution 3D artworks. It is created by [nitrosocke](https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke). It is mainly intended for generating 3D artworks and renders. it is not a general purpose model but it does a good job at what it is designed for.
