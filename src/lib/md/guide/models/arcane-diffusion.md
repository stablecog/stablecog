# Arcane Diffusion

Arcane Diffusion is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained on images from the [TV show Arcane](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11126994/). It is created by [nitrosocke](https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke). It is created for a very specific purpose, mimicking the style of the TV show. It is relatively good at achiving this goal, however it's not a general purpose model.
