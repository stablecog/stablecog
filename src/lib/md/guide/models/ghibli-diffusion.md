# Ghibli Diffusion

Ghibli Diffusion is a fine-tuned Stable Diffusion model trained images from the famous [Studio Ghibli](https://www.studioghibli.com.au). It is created by [nitrosocke](https://huggingface.co/nitrosocke). It is mainly intended for creating anime style images, specifically in the style of Studio Ghibli. It is not a general purpose model but it does a good job at what it is designed for.
